### Fuction used in this app

In this app, I have added a navbar component. The navbar component includes a fetch function that retrieves data from an API. The response from the API is then converted into JSON format and stored in a constant called "data". When the button is clicked, the onClick event function is triggered, which retrieves the API data from the "data" constant. This is how the app works to fetch and display user details.
